# 🚀 Get Your Site on Google's Front Page - Complete Guide

Your Propstars site is optimized for SEO. Now let's get it indexed and ranking on Google!

---

## Phase 1: Deploy Your Site (Required First)

Your site MUST be live on the internet first. Google can't index a local site.

### Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. Go to **https://vercel.com/new**
2. Click **"Import from GitHub"**
3. Select `fantasy-sports-affiliate`
4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. Wait for deployment (1-2 minutes)
6. Get your live URL: `https://fantasy-sports-affiliate.vercel.app`

**Verify it's live:**
- Visit your URL in a browser
- See the Propstars logo? ✅ You're live!

---

## Phase 2: Submit to Google Search Console (5 minutes)

This tells Google your site exists.

### Step 1: Go to Google Search Console

1. Go to **https://search.google.com/search-console**
2. Click **"Start now"** or **"+ Create property"**
3. Enter your Vercel URL: `https://fantasy-sports-affiliate.vercel.app`
4. Click **"Continue"**

### Step 2: Verify Ownership

Google will ask you to prove you own the site. Choose one method:

**Option A: HTML file (Easiest)**
1. Download the HTML file Google gives you
2. Go to your GitHub repo
3. Upload the file to the `public/` folder
4. Go back to Google Search Console
5. Click **"Verify"**
6. ✅ Done!

**Option B: DNS record (Advanced)**
1. Copy the DNS record Google shows
2. Go to your domain registrar (if using custom domain)
3. Add the DNS record
4. Wait 24-48 hours for verification

**Option C: Google Analytics (If you have it)**
1. Connect your Google Analytics account
2. Click **"Verify"**

### Step 3: Submit Sitemap

1. In Google Search Console, click **"Sitemaps"** (left menu)
2. Enter: `your-url/sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

**Your Next.js site auto-generates sitemaps!** 🎉

### Step 4: Request Indexing

1. Go to **"URL Inspection"** (left menu)
2. Enter your homepage URL
3. Click **"Request indexing"**
4. Repeat for platform pages (e.g., `/platform/fanduel`)

---

## Phase 3: Set Up Google Analytics (Optional but Recommended)

Track where your visitors come from.

### Setup Google Analytics 4

1. Go to **https://analytics.google.com**
2. Click **"Start measuring"**
3. Enter property name: `Propstars`
4. Enter your site URL
5. Google will give you a `MEASUREMENT_ID`
6. Add to your site (see below)

### Add to Your Layout

Already included with Vercel Analytics! You can add GA4 too if needed:

```javascript
// In app/layout.js, add this after Analytics import:
import Script from 'next/script'

// In your body, add before </body>:
<Script
  strategy="afterInteractive"
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`}
/>
<Script
  id="google-analytics"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
    `,
  }}
/>
```

(Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual ID from Google Analytics)
